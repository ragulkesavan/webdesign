    			<h2>Why Coding Is Important?</h2>
    			<p>Although computer programming was once seen as a skill reserved for geeks and computer nerds, it’s now regarded as an essential ability for 21st century learners and is becoming a key component of many curriculums, even in primary schools. So what’s the benefit of teaching kids as young as five years old how to code?</P>
			<p>
For starters, basic coding courses in schools provide students with the know-how to develop their own websites, apps and computer software.</p>
			<p>
LinkedIn data shows that skills like mobile development and user interface design will be in high demand in the coming years, and a 2016 Gallup report found that 40% of American schools now offer coding classes, compared to just 25% a few years ago.</p>
			<p>
In Australia, the government has been investing in STEM initiatives in recent years, and coding classes will soon be mandatory in Queensland schools. Meanwhile in the UK, kids aged five and over have been learning the fundamentals of coding since 2014.</p>
			<p>
But coding education can also be beneficial for students who aren’t necessarily interested in pursuing computer programming, but would like to gain a better understanding of technology and how it’s shaping our world.</p>
			<p>
At its most basic, learning how to code is learning to tell machines what to do. But this requires the mastery of a problem-solving skill known as computational thinking, which involves breaking larger tasks into a logical sequence of smaller steps, diagnosing errors and coming up with new approaches when necessary.</p>
			<p>
So what exactly does coding look like in schools and learning institutions throughout the world and why does it matter? We talked to a few teachers and EdTech experts about some of the ways coding is being implemented in education.
